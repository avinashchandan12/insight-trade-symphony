Upcoming earnings reports could provide further direction, but overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic with moderating inflation data supporting potential near-term upside.",

  return "Based on my analysis of the current market conditions and the specific factors you've mentioned, I believe this is a potentially favorable opportunity. The recent pullback in the technology sector appears to be a normal correction rather than the start of a significant downturn. Key technical indicators such as the RSI and MACD suggest the stock is currently oversold. Additionally, the company's recent earnings report exceeded analyst expectations, and their forward guidance remains strong. I would recommend considering a measured position entry with clearly defined stop-loss levels at approximately 5% below your entry point. As always, ensure this fits within your broader portfolio strategy and risk tolerance.";
